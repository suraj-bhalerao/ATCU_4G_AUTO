# Git Collaboration Workflow

This document outlines the recommended workflow for collaborating on a project using Git.

## Initial Setup (One-Time)

1.  **Choose a Git Hosting Service:** Select a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and create an account.
2.  **Create a New Repository:** On the chosen platform, create a new repository for your project. Choose an appropriate name and set the visibility (private for team collaboration).
3.  **Get the Repository URL:** Copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
4.  **Clone the Repository (Local Setup):** Open your terminal and navigate to your desired project directory. Clone the repository using:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

## Daily Workflow

1.  **Pull Changes (Start of Day/Before Making Changes):** Always start by pulling the latest changes from the remote repository to avoid conflicts:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main  # Or git pull origin <your_main_branch_name> if it's not 'main'
    ```

2.  **Create a Branch (For Each Feature/Bug Fix):** Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix to isolate changes:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <feature_name>  # Example: git checkout -b fix-login-bug
    ```

3.  **Make Changes and Commit:** Make your changes, stage them using `git add`, and commit them with a descriptive message:

    ```bash
    git add .               # Stage all changes
    git add <specific_file> # Stage a specific file
    git commit -m "Descriptive commit message" # Example: git commit -m "Fixed login form validation"
    ```

4.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your branch to the remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin <feature_name>
    ```

5.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):** On the platform's website, create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch. Provide a clear title and description for the PR, explaining the changes made.

6.  **Code Review:** Team members review the code in the pull request, providing feedback and suggestions. Address any feedback and push updated commits to your branch (which will automatically update the PR).

7.  **Merge the Pull Request:** Once the code review is approved, the pull request is merged into the main branch.

8.  **Delete Your Branch (Optional, but Recommended):** After the PR is merged, you can delete your local and remote branches:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git branch -d <feature_name>          # Delete local branch
    git push origin --delete <feature_name> # Delete remote branch
    ```

## Important Considerations

*   **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Use clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.
*   **Keep Branches Up-to-Date:** Regularly pull changes from the main branch into your feature branches to minimize merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git checkout <feature_name>
    git pull origin main
    ```

*   **Resolve Conflicts Carefully:** If conflicts arise during a merge or pull, resolve them carefully and test your changes thoroughly.
*   **Communicate with Your Team:** Keep your team informed about your progress and any potential issues.
*   **Use a Consistent Branching Strategy:** Stick to a consistent branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) for better organization.

## Common Git Commands

*   `git status`: Shows the status of your changes.
*   `git log`: Shows the commit history.
*   `git diff`: Shows the differences between files.
*   `git branch`: Lists branches.
*   `git checkout`: Switches branches.
*   `git merge`: Merges branches.

This workflow promotes efficient collaboration, code quality, and a clean project history.
